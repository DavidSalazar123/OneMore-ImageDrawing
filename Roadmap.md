# OneMore Roadmap

1. *Keep Notes at top after sorting* - OneNote keeps the Notes section first in the list
of sections. The Sort command will move this potentially. So should I add an option to 
the Sort dialog to keep Notes at the top?

1. *Favorites Menu* - Manage links to favorite pages through either
a ribbon button in the OneMore group or a menu item off of the OneMore
menu. Simple add/remove functionality, alphabetized. No fancy management.

1. *Others?* - Feautes must be unique, not available in OneNote,
simple and useful.
